  <summary><b>Task 3:</b>Identify instruction type of all the instructions of the Object dump with its exact 32 bits instruction code in the desired instruction type format.</summary><br />

Instruction 1

![task3 ins 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e249637-ac3e-4379-9757-4ad81e0ac178)

Instruction:
lui a0, 0x21

Address:
100b0 (This is the memory address where this instruction is located.)

Operation:
lui (This is the mnemonic for the "Load Immediate Upper" instruction.)

Purpose:
The lui instruction loads an immediate value into the upper 20 bits of the specified register. In this case, it loads the immediate value 0x21 into register a0.

Result in a0:
a0 = 0x210000 (The immediate value 0x21 is placed in the upper 20 bits of a0, and the lower 12 bits are filled with zeros.)

Instruction Format (U-type):
The lui instruction follows the U-type format in RISC-V:

[imm[31:12]] [rd] [opcode]

Immediate (imm[31:12]): A 20-bit immediate value that is left-shifted by 12 bits to form the final 32-bit immediate value.

Destination Register (rd): Specifies the register where the result is stored.

Opcode: Specifies the operation (lui).

Immediate (imm[31:12]):

The immediate value 0x21 is converted to binary:
0x21 â†’ 0010 0001
This binary value is placed in the top 20 bits of the instruction.

Destination Register (rd):
a0 is the destination register.

Opcode:
The opcode for the lui instruction is 0110111.

Encoded Instruction

The instruction lui a0, 0x21 is encoded as follows:
Immediate (20-bit value): 0000 0010 0001 0000 0000.

Destination Register (rd = x10): 01010.

Opcode: 0110111.

Binary Representation:
Combining the fields into binary:
[imm[31:12]] [rd] [opcode]
0010 0001 00000 0110111

Hexadecimal Representation:
Converting the binary representation into hexadecimal:
0010 0001 00000 0110111 â†’ 00210013

In Summary:
At memory address 100b0, the lui a0, 0x21 instruction loads the immediate value 0x21 into the upper 20 bits of register a0, effectively setting a0 to 0x210000. This instruction is commonly used for loading address offsets and constants into registers in RISC-V programs.

addi sp, sp, -16
![task3 ins 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a97db7-5e2d-4502-afc7-86f915276b5a)

Instruction 2
addi sp, sp, -16

Address:
100b4 (This is the memory address where this instruction is located.)

Machine Code:
ff010113 (This is the binary representation of the instruction in hexadecimal format.)

Operation:
addi (This is the mnemonic for the "Add Immediate" instruction.)

Purpose:
The addi instruction is used to add an immediate value to a register. In this case, it's adding -16 to the sp register.

Result in sp:
sp = sp - 16 (This instruction subtracts 16 from the current value of the sp register.)

Instruction Format (I-type):
The addi instruction follows the I-type format in RISC-V:

[imm[11:0]] [rs1] [funct3] [rd] [opcode]

Immediate (imm[11:0]): A 12-bit immediate value.

Source Register 1 (rs1): Specifies the source register for the operation.

Funct3: Specifies the operation type (in this case, addition).

Destination Register (rd): Specifies the register where the result is stored.

Opcode: Specifies the operation (addi).

Immediate (imm[11:0]):
The immediate value is -16, which in binary is 1111111111110000.

Source Register 1 (rs1):
sp (stack pointer) is the source register.

Funct3:The funct3 for the addi instruction is 000.

Destination Register (rd):sp (stack pointer) is also the destination register.

Opcode:The opcode for the addi instruction is 0010011.

Binary Representation:
Combining the fields into binary:
[imm[11:0]] [rs1] [funct3] [rd] [opcode]
1111111111110000 00000 00000 0010011

Hexadecimal Representation:
Converting the binary representation into hexadecimal:
1111111111110000 00000 00000 0010011 â†’ ff010113

In Summary:
The addi sp, sp, -16 instruction subtracts 16 from the stack pointer register (sp), effectively adjusting the stack pointer for function calls or local variable allocation.
