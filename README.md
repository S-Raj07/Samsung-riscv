Task 3

Instruction 1

![task3 ins 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e249637-ac3e-4379-9757-4ad81e0ac178)

Instruction:
lui a0, 0x21

Address:
100b0 (This is the memory address where this instruction is located.)

Operation:
lui (This is the mnemonic for the "Load Immediate Upper" instruction.)

Purpose:
The lui instruction loads an immediate value into the upper 20 bits of the specified register. In this case, it loads the immediate value 0x21 into register a0.

Result in a0:
a0 = 0x210000 (The immediate value 0x21 is placed in the upper 20 bits of a0, and the lower 12 bits are filled with zeros.)

Instruction Format (U-type):
The lui instruction follows the U-type format in RISC-V:

[imm[31:12]] [rd] [opcode]

Immediate (imm[31:12]): A 20-bit immediate value that is left-shifted by 12 bits to form the final 32-bit immediate value.

Destination Register (rd): Specifies the register where the result is stored.

Opcode: Specifies the operation (lui).

Immediate (imm[31:12]):

The immediate value 0x21 is converted to binary:
0x21 â†’ 0010 0001
This binary value is placed in the top 20 bits of the instruction.

Destination Register (rd):
a0 is the destination register.

Opcode:
The opcode for the lui instruction is 0110111.

Encoded Instruction

The instruction lui a0, 0x21 is encoded as follows:
Immediate (20-bit value): 0000 0010 0001 0000 0000.

Destination Register (rd = x10): 01010.

Opcode: 0110111.

Binary Representation:
Combining the fields into binary:
[imm[31:12]] [rd] [opcode]
0010 0001 00000 0110111

Hexadecimal Representation:
Converting the binary representation into hexadecimal:
0010 0001 00000 0110111 â†’ 00210013

In Summary:
At memory address 100b0, the lui a0, 0x21 instruction loads the immediate value 0x21 into the upper 20 bits of register a0, effectively setting a0 to 0x210000. This instruction is commonly used for loading address offsets and constants into registers in RISC-V programs.
